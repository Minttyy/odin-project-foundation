      <li>2 cups long grain rice, rinsed and drained</li>
      <li>1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>1 whole bay leaf</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Garnish:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup oil for frying</li>
      <li>1 cup raw peanuts</li>
      <li>1 (4 ounce) package white anchovies, washed</li>
      <li>4 large hard-boiled eggs, peeled and halved</li>
      <li>1 medium cucumber, sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Sauce:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
      <li>3 medium shallots, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons chile paste</li>
      <li>1 (4 ounce) package white anchovies, washed</li>
      <li>¼ cup tamarind juice</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Step 1: Make the rice: Stir coconut milk, water, rice, fresh ginger,
        ground ginger, bay leaf, and salt together in a medium saucepan. Cover
        and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until
        tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf and keep rice warm until
        garnish and sauce are ready.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 2: While the rice is cooking, make the garnish: Heat 1 cup
        vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in peanuts
        and cook briefly, until lightly browned. Remove peanuts with a slotted
        spoon and place onto paper towels to soak up excess grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3: Return the skillet to the stove. Stir in anchovies and cook,
        turning occasionally, until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted
        spoon and place on paper towels. Discard oil and wipe out the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4: Make the sauce: Heat oil in the clean skillet. Stir in onion,
        shallots, and garlic; cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in chile
        paste and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally; if mixture is too
        dry, add water as needed. Stir in anchovies and cook for 5 minutes. Stir
        in tamarind juice, sugar, and salt; simmer until sauce is thick, about 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 5: Ladle warm rice into bowls. Top with warm sauce, then top with
        peanuts, fried anchovies, hard-boiled eggs, and cucumber.
